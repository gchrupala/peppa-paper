\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset consists of the complete set of video of the
English-language version of {\it Peppa Pig}. In addition to the raw
videos we  also use the annotation created by
\citep{papasarantopoulos2021narration}.

These annotations feature written transcriptions of the audio as well
as segmentation into {\it dialog} and {\it narration}. Dialog are the
parts spoken by the characters, while narrations are comments inserted
by narrator, which are more descriptive in nature. All the narration
segments are uttered by the same actor. We use the dialogs for
training the model, and set aside the narrations for evaluation
purposes only.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
For training, we do not use word or sentence level segmentation in
order to make the setting more naturalistic. Instead we split the
dialog sections into 3.2 second non-overlapping fragments. The video
is subsampled to 10 frames per second, and to 180x100 resolution. The
audio is converted to mono by averaging the two channels  and the raw
waveform is used as input.
