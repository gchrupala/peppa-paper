  \noindent
  This survey provides an overview of the evolution of visually
  grounded models of spoken language over the last 20 years.  Such
  models are inspired by the observation that when children pick up a
  language, they rely on a wide range of indirect and noisy clues,
  crucially including signals from the visual modality co-occurring
  with spoken utterances.  Several fields have made important
  contributions to this approach to modeling or mimicking the process
  of learning language: Machine Learning, Natural Language and Speech
  Processing, Computer Vision and Cognitive Science. The current paper
  brings together these contributions in order to provide a useful
  introduction and overview for practitioners in all these areas.  We
  discuss the central research questions addressed, the timeline of
  developments, and the datasets which enabled much of this work. We
  then summarize the main modeling architectures and offer an
  exhaustive overview of the evaluation metrics and analysis
  techniques.
