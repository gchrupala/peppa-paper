\paragraph{Performance metrics}


In the case of the narration data this scores is not confounded by
speaker-based clues, which is an indication that the model possibly
learned to detect some aspects of utterance meaning. We investigate
this hypothesis further using multiple representational similarity
analysis.

\paragraph{Targeted Triplets}
As a first baseline, we evaluate a model that has been pretrained but not fine-tuned on our dataset. The resulting performance is, as expected, close to chance level: 0.538.\todo{MN: add baselines: model that is completely untrained, and model where only the attention pooling layers are finetuned} Additionally, we evaluate a model that is trained using static (image) data instead of video. The average accuracy is 0.705 . Finally, the best performing model according to the
performance metrics (ID 68, audio and video pretraining) achieves an average
targeted triplets accuracy of 0.745.

\Cref{fig:accuracy_targeted_triplets_nouns} and
\ref{fig:accuracy_targeted_triplets_verbs} show per-word
accuracy for nouns and verbs, respectively. We perform boostrapping (n\_resampling = 100) to estimate mean and standard deviation for each accuracy score.

We further compute correlations between the per-word accuracy and two possible predictors of age of acquisition: frequency and concreteness. The resulting correlations are presented in Appendix \ref{app:targeted_triplets_eval}. We do not find any significant correlation between the model's per-word accuracy and word concreteness or input frequency of a word in the training data.
