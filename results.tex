\paragraph{Performance metrics}
\Cref{tab:scores-dialog} and \Cref{tab:scores-narration} show
the performance of several model configurations on the retrieval and
triplet tasks on the dialog and narration datasets respectively.

In the case of the narration data this scores is not confounded by
speaker-based clues, which is an indication that the model possibly
learned to detect some aspects of utterance meaning. We investigate
this hypothesis further using multiple representational similarity
analysis.

\paragraph{Targeted Triplets}
As a first baseline, we evaluate a model that has been pretrained but not fine-tuned on our dataset. The resulting performance is, as expected, close to chance level: 0.538 . Additionally, we evaluate a model that is trained using static (image) data instead of video. The average accuracy is 0.705 . Finally, the best performing model according to the
performance metrics (ID 68, audio and video pretraining) achieves an average
targeted triplets accuracy of 0.745 .

\Cref{fig:accuracy_targeted_triplets_nouns} and
\Cref{fig:accuracy_targeted_triplets_verbs} show per-word
accuracy for nouns and verbs, respectively. The vertical
bars indicate the standard deviation as estimated using bootstrapping
tests.

We further compute correlations between the per-word accuracy and two possible predictors of age of acquisition: frequency and concreteness. The resulting correlations are presented in Appendix \ref{app:targeted_triplets_eval}. We do not find any significant correlation between the model's per-word accuracy and word concreteness or input frequency of a word in the training data.
