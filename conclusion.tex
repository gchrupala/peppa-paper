\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Summary of findings.

Potentially discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item Impact of sampling 
\item Dialogue vs. narration
\end{itemize}

Future direction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyses on whether/what the model learns about non-linguistic cues and how it employs them in the retrieval task (e.g. speaker identification, background noise, etc.). 
\item In-depth (probing-style) analysis on word and sub-word identification. 
\item Compare static and dynamic models in more detail to see where the dynamic model gains on performance. 
\end{itemize}
