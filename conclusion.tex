\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our results suggest that despite the challenges inherent to the
naturalistic aspects of the \emph{Peppa Pig} dataset, a simple bimodal
architecture trained on it captures aspects of visual meaning of individual 
words as well as full utterances, and generalizes well to narrative utterances
featuring a single unseen speaker and a descriptive rather than
conversational style. We saw that generalization is substantially
boosted by fine-tuning audio representations pretrained on unlabeled
single-modality speech data. Fine-tuning a pretrained video encoder
also makes a contribution, but is less crucial to generalization from
dialog to narration.


\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}
We model the acquisition of spoken language from both
language-internal correlations as well as from grounding in vision in
a simplistic way: we fine-tune an audio encoder pretrained on read
speech.
In future, it would be interesting to make the setting
more realistic by using pretraining data which reflect a young
learner's experience more closely, and to realistically interleave learning via
self-supervision from speech and via grounding in vision.
Ideally we would also want to dispense with
supervised pretraining of the video encoder and rather use a model pretrained in a
self-supervised way also for this modality.

In order to investigate what aspects of spoken language our model
acquires, we would like to carry out in-depth analyses of learned 
representations on sub-word, lexical, and phrasal levels. It would also be 
worthwhile to figure out the details of how specifically temporal information 
in video contributes to acquiring linguistic knowledge. While some analyses in 
this direction were currently constrained by the size of the evaluation 
dataset, in the future one could apply similar methods on more large-scale data.

Using naturalistic datasets such as the \textit{Peppa Pig} cartoons, we belief 
that it will be possible relate findings more closely to theories in 
language acquisition in the real world.
